megam_play
==========

API server (REST based) for the "megam platform". The API server allows the following resources. 

### Resources

|                      |            |
|:---------------------|:-----------|
| **auth**       	   |    GET
| 			     	   | 
| **accounts**    	   |    GET
| 			     	   | 
| **nodes**     	   |    GET
| **nodes\:node_id**   |    GET
| **nodes\content**    |    POST
|		 		       | 
| **logs**             |    GET
| **logs\:node_id**    |    GET

The resources are portected using [HMAC](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2104.txt) based authorization, which 
mean when a customer is onboarded a shared key is generated in stored in a datasource. 
[Riak](http:\\basho.com) is used as the datastore to onboard a customer.

> sbt test

This is interfaced from megam_api ruby [megam_api](https://github.com/indykish/megam_api.git) 


### Production (`api.megam.co` in our case)

* Chef cookbooks used at megam * coming soon. [megamn chef-repo](https://github.com/indykish/chef-repo)

> Run behind nginx server, load balanced.

> Riak datastore is clustered.

#### DEB Package using sbt.

The package structure shall be as per the debian guidelines. This uses sbt-native-packager plugin.
